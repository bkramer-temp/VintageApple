TRAILS

This game started out being like TRON, but that got boring pretty quickly. My daughter suggested I make them more like
snakes that grow.  So this version will give you a trail that starts out short, and eating morsels will make your trail grow!

The left player plays with the letters I, J, K, and L.  The right player plays with the joystick.

Need to speed up to cut off your opponent or grab that next morsel faster? Use the space bar (left player) or joystick button (right player).

Corral your opponent and force them to crash, and you win.

Have fun!
